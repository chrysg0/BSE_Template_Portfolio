# Rasberry Pi Image and Facial Recognition
My project is Rasberry Pi image and facial recognition. I will be using a Rasberry Pi, camera, and LCD monitor in this project. I will make a project that can detect faces in an image and camera!

# Final Milestone
Since my second milestone, I have setup email notifications to the facial recognition Python code. I modified the code using Twilio SendGrid.
One of the challenges faced in the third milestone was

# Second Milestone: Facial Recognition
Since my previous milestone, I have enabled and installed the camera module into the Rasberry Pi. I Installed OpenCV by running certain commands into the terminal. I copied the files containing the Python code I needed. Finally, I took photos of myself to train my Rasberry Pi to recognize my face.

One of the challenges faced in the second milestone was enabling the camera.

In future milestones, the challenges to be addressed include:

- The eyes in image recognition detect the mouth as the eyes
- The ears are not detected

To complete the project, the following steps will be taken in the next milestones:

- Setup Email Notifications for Raspberry Pi Facial Recognition

# First Milestone: Image Recognition

My first milestone started with setting up the Rasberry pi and LCD monitor. An SD card was inserted into the Pi to supply storage and memory to the computer. Then, I copied code in Thonny and installed OpenCV in the Raspberry Pi terminal to recognize an image. After that, I used an online jpg image for my code. I ran the code.py code, which was able to correctly detect the image's face.

One of the challenges faced in the first milestone was getting the LCD monitor to connect to the Rasberry Pi and receive signal.

In future milestones, the challenges to be addressed include:

- I need a Rasberry Pi camera.
- I hope to code my Rasberry Pi to detect an images' nose, eyes and smile.

To complete the project, the following steps will be taken in the next milestones:

- I will set up the Rasberry Pi camera.
- It will be able to detect my face in the camera.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
